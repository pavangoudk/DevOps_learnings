# Networking Fundamentals (Part 1): IP Addresses, Subnets, CIDR, and Ports

## Video purpose & who it’s for (in the speaker’s words)

- Networking terms like IP address, subnet, CIDR range, and OSI model can be confusing.
- Goal: explain **networking fundamentals** using “basic examples that anyone can understand.”
- Relevance: important for **DevOps engineers, data engineers, full stack engineers** to understand infrastructure and application workflow.

### IP Address (IPv4)

- *“IP address is used to… provide a unique address to a particular device that is connected to your network.”*
- Home-network example:
- A router creates a local Wi‑Fi network.
- 2 people × 2 devices each → 4 devices on the same network.
- If one device connects to a payments site (or a child uses Instagram / someone uses YouTube), tracking or blocking requires device-level identification.
- Without unique IDs, you’d end up blocking everyone—so each device needs its own unique identifier → **IP address**.
- Why a standard format is needed:
- You could invent a small custom scheme for 4 devices, but it breaks at scale (e.g., schools/universities with 10,000–20,000 devices).
- So a consistent standard is used: **IPv4** (speaker notes IPv6 exists and will be discussed later).

#### How IPv4 addresses look

- Examples given (format focus): `172.16.34.x`, `10.1.2.4`
- *IPv4 addresses appear as four numbers separated by dots.*
- Each of the four numbers:
- ranges from **0 to 255**
- because of how computers represent the address internally (bits/bytes).

#### Why “0–255” (bytes and bits)

- *“IP address is nothing but four bytes or 32 bits.”*
- Structure:
- 4 bytes total
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- dots separate the bytes (octets)
- Therefore each “dot-separated number” is limited to values representable in 8 bits → max is 255.

#### Binary interpretation example (how the computer “understands” it)

- Example: `192` in a byte is shown as `11000000`
- Speaker’s method:
- bits map to powers of 2 (from 202^020 up to 272^727)
- `192 = 2^7 + 2^6 = 128 + 64`
- Why 255 is the maximum:
- all 8 bits set to 1 ⇒ sum of 202^020 through 272^727 ⇒ 255
- Validation example:
- `192.600.12.254` is **not** a valid IPv4 address because `600` is outside 0–255.

### ifconfig / ipconfig (checking your device IP)

- Speaker suggests running:
- `ifconfig` (common on Unix/Linux/macOS-like environments)
- `ipconfig` (common on Windows)
- Purpose: to see your device’s IP address in the IPv4 dotted format.

### Subnetting (Subnets)

- Office network example (security motivation):
- Company requests a large pool (e.g., ~65,000 IP addresses) for an office/school network.
- If everyone shares one “free Wi‑Fi” network and one employee hits a malicious site, the attacker can potentially move through the network to other devices.
- Result: sensitive assets (payroll, bank details/financial data, etc.) could be exposed.
- *“Subnet is basically… sub networking… [where] you split [a bigger network] into two parts.”*
- Practical split described:
1. **Secure network** (finance/sensitive systems only)
2. **Free network** (general employee access)
- Why do this:
- *advantage is “security… privacy… proper isolation.”*
- Speaker notes you can subnet even at home (e.g., separate heavy-usage appliances from others).

#### Private vs Public subnet

- *“Private subnet is… does not have access to Internet.”*
- *“Public subnet… has access to Internet.”*
- High-level “how” (cloud context):
- You can grant internet access by attaching **route tables** and pointing a route to an **internet gateway** (details can be ignored for fundamentals, per speaker).

### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) / “CIDR range”

- Problem posed: once you have a large network (e.g., a VPC), how do you decide how many IPs each subnet gets?
- *“CIDR is a way of explaining how many IP addresses are available in a particular subnet.”*
- Cloud placement in workflow (speaker’s AWS framing):
- Create **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** (speaker: *“VPC is… nothing but a private network”*)
- Inside VPC, create subnets
- While creating a subnet, you must enter its **CIDR range**

#### Example: needing 256 IP addresses

- Speaker example CIDR: `172.16.3.0/24`
- Explanation logic (as presented):
- IPv4 has 32 total bits.
- `/24` means **24 bits are fixed**, leaving **8 bits variable**.
- Variable bits = 8 → number of addresses = 28=2562^8 = 25628=256.
- So the subnet can cover `172.16.3.0` through `172.16.3.255`.

#### Example: needing only 2 IP addresses

- Speaker example CIDR: `172.16.3.0/31`
- Logic:
- 32 − 31 = 1 bit left
- 21=22^1 = 221=2 addresses

#### The speaker’s “always do this” shortcut

- Compute: **number of IPs = 2(32−/prefix)2^{(32 - /prefix)}2(32−/prefix)**
- `/24` → 32 − 24 = 8 → 28=2562^8 = 25628=256
- `/27` → 32 − 27 = 5 → 25=322^5 = 3225=32
- `/29` → 32 − 29 = 3 → 23=82^3 = 823=8

#### Class-style labels (as referenced by the speaker)

- `/8` → “Class A” (speaker’s phrasing)
- `/16` → “Class B”
- `/24` → “Class C”
- Size intuition given:
- `/24` ~ 256
- `/16` ~ 256×256
- `/8` ~ 256×256×256

#### “CIDR calculators” practice advice

- Speaker recommendation:
- use online CIDR calculators to validate your manual calculations
- practice by picking random examples and estimating:
- CIDR prefix from required IPs, or
- IP count from a CIDR

#### Assignments given in the video

- Convert to bits (octet/binary form): `172.32.16.1`
- Compute IP counts / interpret CIDR:
- `172.68.3.0/30` → how many IPs?
- `10.0.0.0/8` → how many IPs?

#### Private IP “starting numbers” (as stated)

- Speaker says private subnets commonly start with: **192, 172, 10**
- Rationale given:
- using public IPs can conflict (example: `8.8.8.8` is public and used by Google DNS in the speaker’s example)
- so private networks should use the “private” ranges the speaker mentions.

### Ports

- Speaker frames ports as a simple concept seen in URLs like:
- `:80`, `:443`, etc.
- On a virtual machine (VM), multiple applications can run simultaneously.
- *Ports are used to bind and distinguish applications on the same instance.*
- *“Port is a unique number for your application… [so] you can distinguish the request has to go to which particular application.”*
- Practical access pattern described:
- You need:
1. the VM’s **IP address** (public if accessing from the internet)
2. the application’s **port**
- Example format: `public-ip:9191` (or `public-ip:5162`)
- Port-selection guidance (experience-based):
- avoid commonly claimed ports (speaker examples):
- MySQL often uses `3306`
- Jenkins often starts on `8080`
- choose other unique ports (speaker examples like `9000`, `9191`)

### OSI Model (deferred to next video)

- Speaker says the remaining major topic is the **OSI model**:
- will cover HTTP, TCP, and layers 1–7
- This is planned as “part 2” in the playlist.
